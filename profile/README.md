# Climate NLP Community

We're a collective of practitioners and researchers working on natural language processing applied to various climate change applications. 

We are convened by folks at [Climate Policy Radar](https://climatepolicyradar.org) and [Climate+Tech](https://climateandtech.com/)

For more information see our [main repo](https://github.com/climatenlpcommunity/climatenlpcommunity).
